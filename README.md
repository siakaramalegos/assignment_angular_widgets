Wee! Restaurant reviews!
[A React.js JavaScript project from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)... the original assignment was on Angular controllers, directives, bindings, filters, and more, but I chose to do this project in React.js instead.

To run locally, you may need to run a tiny webserver:
```
$ ruby -run -e httpd . -p 3000
```
